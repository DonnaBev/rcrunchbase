# rcrunchbase
*updated for crunchbase API v3!*
An R client for the CrunchBase API. Developed with a particular focus on Prospect Development

## Installation
The easiest way to install `rcrunchbase` is using `devtools`. If you don't have devtools installed, then start by typing:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once you have devtools installed, just use `install_github`:

```R
devtools::install_github("tarakc02/rcrunchbase")
```

From there, if you're not sure how to get started, try to follow along with the "Getting started" vignette: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tarakc02/rcrunchbase/blob/master/vignettes/getting-started.html (note that you'll need to sign up to receive an API key from CrunchBase, here: http://data.crunchbase.com/)
